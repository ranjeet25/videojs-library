## Video js Library ‚≠êüìΩÔ∏è

### In this project I have used video.js library, A library that enables us to make HTML videos very easily with lots of features.
In this project you will find a web page with two videos and if you play first video the second video will also get started.
This was made possible with the help of javascript.


### The web page you will find at **quatumhunt-task.netlify.app**
### Thank you!!
