# quatumhunt-task6
Hey 
In this project I have used video.js library, A library that enables us to make HTML videos very easily with lots of features.
In this project you will find a web page with two videos and if you play first video the second video will also get started.
This was made possible with the help of javascript.


The web page you will find at quatumhunt-task.netlify.app
Thank you!!
